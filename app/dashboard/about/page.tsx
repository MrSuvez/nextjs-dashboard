        I am a seasoned Software Engineer with over 20 years of experience, specializing in React, Next.js, and a broad range of modern web technologies.<br /><br /> 
        This example showcases full-stack development, including frontend implementation, backend API integration, PostgreSQL database design, and secure authentication.<br /><br /> 
        As the founder of an IoT startup, I bring hands-on experience in hardware design, embedded firmware development, and launching mobile, e-commerce, and SaaS applications.<br /><br /> 
        I have real-world experience in commercializing products—navigating compliance and regulatory processes, as well as leading design, manufacturing, and market delivery.<br /><br /> 
        Beyond engineering, I am a mentor—committed to guiding others in their professional growth—and a consultant, partnering with individuals and companies to build their products and elevate their brands.<br /><br /> 
        I am also deeply passionate about vertical and indoor farming, working to merge technology and agriculture in innovative and sustainable ways.<br />
